# Banking Management System (Console-Based)

## Overview

The Banking Management System is a simple, console-based Java application designed to handle basic banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, funds transfer, and transaction history. It uses **file handling** for persistent storage of account information and transaction data. This project is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming principles and includes robust error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient balance.

---

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create a new account by providing their name, account number, PIN, and an initial deposit.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check the balance of their account by entering the account number and PIN.
- **Money Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Money Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they enter the correct PIN and have sufficient funds.
- **Fund Transfer**: Allows users to transfer money from one account to another. Both accounts need to be verified using their PIN.
- **Transaction History**: Users can view a detailed history of all transactions made on their account (deposits, withdrawals, and transfers).
- **Persistent Storage**: Account information and transaction history are saved to a file (`AccountFile.txt`) for data persistence across sessions.
